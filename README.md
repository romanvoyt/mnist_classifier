# MNIST Neural Network Classifier

This project implements a simple neural network to classify the MNIST dataset using numpy and other Python libraries. The network is trained to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset.

## Project Description

The project demonstrates the implementation of a basic neural network from scratch using numpy. It includes functions for forward and backward propagation, weight initialization, and evaluation. The model is trained on the MNIST training set and evaluated on the test set. The training process and results are visualized using Plotly.

## Features

- **Data Fetching**: Fetches the MNIST dataset from Yann LeCun's website.
- **Neural Network Implementation**: Implements forward and backward propagation, weight initialization, and evaluation functions.
- **Training Loop**: Trains the neural network on the MNIST training set and logs the progress.
- **Visualization**: Uses Plotly to visualize training loss and accuracy.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluates the model on the MNIST test set.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- pytroch

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
